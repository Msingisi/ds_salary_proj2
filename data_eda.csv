OPCS Context

Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS) plays a pivotal role in achieving the World Bank Group's mission. OPCS assists frontline staff in delivering results to clients through sound operations policy and strong country support. In the World Bank Group structure, OPCS is at the center of operations and delivery, and serves as the link between the Global Practices and the Regions. OPCS develops and oversees the Bank's operational policies for country strategies, lending operations, advisory services and analytical support, financial management, procurement, and environmental and social safeguards. It also oversees the Bank Group's Corporate Scorecard; manages interactions with the Bank's oversight units; and co-leads the results measurement and evaluation stream in the Bank Group. OPCS teams provide advice and support to World Bank management and staff as well as hands-¬on assistance to help teams leverage the Bank's policies, processes, and risk management tools for our country clients. Working in OPCS helps World Bank professionals gain broad exposure to strategic operations issues and develop a deeper understanding of the Bank's business. Some of the major initiatives OPCS is currently working on include: simplifying processes and procedures to help clients get faster results; implementing the new country engagement model and new operations risk framework; reforming environmental and social safeguards; implementing the new procurement framework; and measuring client feedback and progress towards the Bank Group's goals. OPCS is organized into the Front Office and four departments:

The Front Office (OPSFO) focuses on supporting the OPCS Vice President (VP) in the management of the operations complex and the delivery of key corporate policy commitments and reforms;
Operations Standards, Procurement, Financial Management (OPSPF) is responsible for safeguards, procurement, financial management and anti-corruption policies and support to operations;
Operations Policy (OPSPO) consolidates the corporate support and oversight of country strategies and all financing and advisory instruments as well as managing the Operations Committee and the Operations Help Desk;
Operations Strategy, Risk, Results and Learning (OPSRL) focuses on WB strategy; risk management in operations, strengthening results and effectiveness throughout the institution, including the Corporate Scorecard; support to the country directors’ and management communities; and operational learning; and
Operations Standards, Environment and Social (OPSES) is responsible for the Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) and Safeguard Policies, including support to operations, learning and training, knowledge management, reporting, interface with the Inspection Panel, and management of the Grievance Redress Service (GRS).

The Strategy, Results and Risk Unit (OPSSR), within OPSRL, encompasses four interlinked streams of work (i) it supports the OPSVP and the MDs to report on results spearheaded by Practice Groups and Regions, including through yearly Board updates on the WBGs Corporate Scorecards, and stewardship of the IDA Results Measurement System and policy commitments; (ii) it coordinates the overall engagement with the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG), including by crafting corporate responses to independent evaluations and reporting annually on the Management Action Record; (iii) it works with task teams and other units in OPCS and across GPs and Regions to support operations through relevant advice and strengthen skills, guidance, and tools to enhance Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) underpinning results reporting.; and (iv) it spearheads WBG efforts towards greater outcome orientation, including external coordination on results with other Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs).

United States","Interested in driving data science innovation?

We are growing! We have multiple open data scientist positions. In this position you’ll be a team member collaborating on data science projects with disciplined utility experts and E Source data scientists, software engineers, and machine learning engineering experts. Example projects include predicting asset failures, detecting usage of grid-impacting customer end uses, and forecasting impacts and consumer adoption of utility-managed programs and services.

E Source is a solutions-based consulting, research and advisory, and data science firm that’s been a change agent in the utility industry for over 30 years.

What you’ll do
Contributing to translating a scope of work into technical tasks for project team assignments using Jira issues
Data exploration and evaluating sufficiency to perform data science tasks
Developing statistical and machine learning models and validating model performance
Collaborating on the development and maintenance of data science pipelines for repeated execution
Code repository management and code reviews
Communicating with clients (internal or external) throughout the data science project lifecycle
Identifying data sources that can facilitate data science solutions to utility industry problems

You’ll be a full-time member of the E Source Data Science team. Our data science positions appeal to self-starters who welcome and excel in team-based, collaborative projects from conception to end-user handoff, providing an excellent customer experience throughout. The ability to simplify complex analyses into understandable concepts that are applicable to management and operations staff is highly desired.

What will make you a good fit

Candidates should have a four-year college degree with a master’s or PhD preferred in a technical field such as statistics, economics, mathematics, or electrical engineering. Strong communication and presentation skills are required.

Our ideal candidates will have significant experience using R or Python (with a preference for fluency in both) in the context of data science proof of concept and ongoing operational support projects, in AWS and Azure workspaces. Databricks experience is a plus. You should have a strong understanding of several different families of statistical and machine learning models, for example:
Generalized linear models
Time series approaches
Penalized regression models
Tree-based ensemble models
Neural network models
Natural language processing

The ideal candidate will have professional experience in the utility sector and familiarity with customer and distribution grid data models, but this is not required.

A little about E Source

Utilities across the US and Canada face the same fundamental, day-to-day challenges: to ensure reliable service for every customer while maintaining and modernizing aging distribution networks and meeting regulatory requirements—all while keeping rates affordable. At the same time, climate change has created a common, universal call to action: to reduce our carbon impact, improve our environment, and ensure the prosperity of future generations.

At E Source, we’re dedicated to helping every utility become a Sustainable Utility. That means doing the hard work it takes to achieve goals that often seem at odds with one another:

Environmental responsibility. Decarbonizing operations, reducing emissions, eliminating water leaks, and finding efficiencies.
Reliability. Providing safe, continuous, and consistent service in the face of increasing volatility caused by climate change, including extreme weather, drought, and fire.
Equity. Making services and programs truly available to all, especially low- and moderate-income residential customers and small and midsize businesses that are often disproportionately impacted by societal events.
Financial stability. Ensuring a bottom line that affords capital and operational expenditures while enabling innovation and giving back to our communities.

E Source blends industry-leading research, predictive data science, and solution services to help utilities make better decisions to serve their customers, their bottom line, and our planet. With a commitment to practical innovation, we use more than three decades of utility-focused experience and our unique solution set to help our clients become a Sustainable Utility.

Benefits

We offer excellent insurance packages, including medical, dental, and vision plans; company-paid life insurance; company-paid long- and short-term disability insurance; and medical and dependent-care flexible spending plans.
We provide a flexible time off (FTO) program; E Source employees can take as many paid days off per year as they need, with manager approval, while fulfilling their work obligations and ensuring proper coverage of their responsibilities.
We offer flexible schedules, flexible work locations, and a paid parental leave benefit.
We provide a 401(k)/RRSP with a 3% employer match.

The budgeted salary for this position is $90,000–$140,000 USD (includes base salary + annual bonus). Actual pay will be adjusted based on experience.

This role will be 100% remote.

Applicants must be authorized to work for any employer in the US. We’re unable to sponsor or take over sponsorship of employment visas at this time.

All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or status as a protected veteran.

San Francisco, CA","ABOUT RETOOL:
Nearly every company in the world runs on custom software: Gartner estimates that up to 50% of all code is written for internal use. This is the operational software for refunding orders, underwriting loans, onboarding employees, analyzing transactions, and providing customer support. But most companies don't have adequate resources to properly invest in these tools, leading to a lot of old and clunky internal software or, even worse, users still stuck in manual and spreadsheet flows.
At Retool, we're on a mission to bring good software to everyone. We're building a new type of development platform that combines the benefits of traditional software development with a drag-and-drop UI editor and AI, making it dramatically faster to build internal tools. We believe that the future of software development lies in abstracting away the tedious and repetitive tasks developers waste time on, while creating reusable components that act as a force multiplier for future developers and projects. The result is not just productivity, but good software by default. And that's a mission worth striving for.
Today, our customers span from small startups building their first operational tools to Fortune 500 companies building mission-critical apps for thousands of users across their business. Interested in joining us? Let us know!
WHY WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOU:
Retool has set out to radically rethink how this custom internal software is built. We've created a new type of development environment, combining visual, drag-and-drop manipulation with code-based customization. It seamlessly integrates with nearly any data source and enables instant deployment to end-users. It's a force multiplier for developers building internal tools dramatically faster and easier than writing software from scratch.
Retool is a fast-growing company with quickly evolving business needs. We're looking to hire a Data Scientist to take the lead on advanced analytics and predictive modeling to serve the needs of our business today and for a broader scale years from now. We're looking for someone ready to get their hands dirty, motivated by impacting the business, and constantly curious. This is the right role for someone who thrives while making sense of the blurry space that is data at a high-growth startup.
WHY WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOU:
Retool's user base is growing quickly, and we've found ourselves with more evidence to answer an increasing number of questions that drive our business and product. We're looking to hire a Data Scientist to take the lead on analysis and metrics to inform our product and business. We're looking for someone passionate about analyzing data across all domains, motivated by having an impact on the business, and is constantly curious. This is the right role for someone who thrives from making sense of the blurry space that is data at high growth startup.
WHAT YOU'LL DO:
As a member of the data team, you'll play a pivotal role in building the data culture at Retool. You'll initiate projects that solidify Retool's data reporting capabilities and help the company remain data-driven. You'll architect data models and develop data sets to streamline operations, inform strategic priorities, and develop product insights. You'll apply statistical knowledge and the scientific method to the data questions we face today, and help us think critically about the questions of tomorrow. We'll look to you to define key metrics and develop dashboards that empower stakeholders to make data-informed decisions.
WHO YOU'LL WORK WITH
As part of our data team, you'll work with stakeholders across the business, including finance, marketing, engineering, product, operations, and support. You'll be joining a broader team of Retools who are passionate about serving our customers, enjoy collaborating to build an incredibly innovative product, and enjoy swapping stories.

United States","About Us
We believe that life is better when you’re with your friends, and our mission is to fill everyone’s life with rich and meaningful friendships. We do this by creating the easiest way to hear your friends’ voices throughout the day, to meet their friends, and to talk about anything. As the world goes increasingly remote, we think being with friends is more important than ever.

We take pride in being a small and productive team, with a relentless focus on building a product that people love. As a company we are well funded, with backing from a16z and dozens of the best angel investors in the world, providing us with years of runway. We love what we do and have a lot of work ahead of us. If this sounds interesting to you, we’d love to talk.

The Role
As a Product Data Scientist, you will work closely with our product and engineering teams to formulate and answer key questions about our product. You will play a central role in collecting, modeling, and analyzing data, and will drive meaningful changes to our product and user experiences based on your findings. In this role, you will report to our Head of Growth. We are a remote-first company, but have a headquarters office in San Francisco.

In this role, you will play a key part in defining the data culture within Clubhouse and ensure that we have principled, data-driven decision-making processes. As part of the early data team, you will work on numerous zero-to-one projects and will have a direct impact on our product direction. You’ll have the opportunity to work alongside our product and engineering teams on high-profile feature launches that are used by millions of people.

Who you are
You are curious, inquisitive, and enjoy solving ambiguous, open-ended problems. You are able to identify high impact problem areas with little direction. You have a healthy skepticism about data and know when to dig deeper into a problem.
You bring deep experience in product analytics and experiment design. You likely bring 4+ years of experience as a product data scientist or product analyst and have deep experience working on consumer products. You are comfortable with advanced modeling and statistical techniques and are highly fluent in SQL and Python. You have deep experience with experiment design and analysis.
You are a strong communicator and are able to explain complex concepts to a wide audience. You are adept at crafting clear and impactful data visualizations.
You are meticulous and forthright. You are experienced with finding clear answers despite messy data sets, and are able to catch data issues as they arise.
You bias towards action. You like to build and ship - favoring practical choices, speed and a respect for sequencing. You focus on the things that matter and push back on things that don’t. You make deadlines for yourself and you move fast.
You’re scrappy and entrepreneurial. You thrive in fast-paced environments and are comfortable with not knowing the answer to something. You are willing to roll up your sleeves no matter what the challenge is.
You take pride in what you do. You care deeply about your work. You read through details and think about every bit of the user experience. If something seems off, you come up with a good solution and fix it without being asked to do so. You’re proactive with suggestions and people know they can count on you to get things done.

What you will do
You’ll help the team untangle key product questions with the team. There are numerous complex product questions that we would look to a data partner to help the team untangle. On a given day, you may be performing and sharing complex analyses that inform a wide variety of decisions. Or you may be playing a hands-on role in product launches, ensuring that we understand the impact of new features on users and can identify potential issues early in the process. You will have the opportunity to do foundational analysis on important, unsolved questions across a wide range of problem spaces.
You’ll grow and improve rapidly. At Clubhouse you’ll be working with an incredible team, who love to learn from and teach each other. You’ll find yourself stretching to new areas, immersed in feedback, challenged by your teammates, and growing your skills on a daily basis.
You’ll shape the product strategy. You will get to use your own product (and talk with others while they are using it) every day, and have significant input into its development. Your ideas will always be heard.
You’ll be an owner. We believe in hiring people and giving them as much responsibility as they can handle. Whether it’s leading our work on a new platform or single-handedly figuring out how to scale concurrent audio streams to reach millions of users, we’ll make sure you are always pushing yourself to new levels.
You’ll create something meaningful. Social products allow people to connect in ways that were never before possible. When the telephone was invented, it suddenly allowed people to speak with others across the world. Thanks to FaceTime, grandparents everywhere can now watch their grandchildren grow up. At Clubhouse, you’ll be figuring out something entirely new for the world—a positive product that brings people’s voices together for deep and meaningful conversations, creates new relationships, builds empathy across

The salary for this position is between $190,000 and $246,000. It may vary based on the applicant’s level of experience, education, specialized knowledge, skills, and the market rate for similar positions. The salary range is subject to change and may be modified in the future.

As an early team member at Clubhouse you will be a critical voice and have significant influence over the direction of the company. We will compensate you well, invest deeply in your development, and ensure this is the single best work experience of your life.

Our users come from all walks of life, and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds. Our company is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

When you join the E3 team, you will be working on some of the most important energy issues with some of the top minds in the electricity industry. We help shape energy and climate policy, play vital roles in regulatory proceedings, advise executives, and inform investment and planning selections. At E3, you will be challenged and inspired.

Who We Are
Founded in 1989, Energy + Environmental Economics (E3) is a fast-growing energy consulting firm that helps utilities, regulators, policy makers, developers, and investors make the most educated strategic decisions possible as they implement new public policies, deploy and develop new technologies, and address customers’ shifting expectations. We have offices in San Francisco, New York City, Boston, Denver, and Calgary.

Because E3 works with customers from all sectors of the electricity industry, we provide a 360-degree knowledge of markets, planning, policy, regulation, and environmental factors. Just as important, we are driven to deliver clear, unbiased evaluations that help customers make informed decisions.

E3 works on high-profile, high-impact projects in jurisdictions that spearhead the implementation of clean energy policy. In California, Hawaii, and New York, we are advising state agencies and regulators about how to implement clean energy policies with an emphasis on customer incentives and markets. E3 is also expanding its international presence with recent projects in Europe, China, India, and Africa.

The DERs modeled include distributed solar (PV), energy storage, electric vehicles, and building electrification measures among others. The tools use data from a variety of sources that are pre-processed and stored in a datalake for geospatial analysis using Uber’s H3 indexing system. This tool has been used to visualize EV charger installations in disadvantaged communities in California, distribution network capacity constraints from transportation and building electrification in New York City and geospatially granular adoption of DER in Nevada.

A little about E Source

Utilities across the US and Canada face the same fundamental, day-to-day challenges: to ensure reliable service for every customer while maintaining and modernizing aging distribution networks and meeting regulatory requirements—all while keeping rates affordable. At the same time, climate change has created a common, universal call to action: to reduce our carbon impact, improve our environment, and ensure the prosperity of future generations.

At E Source, we’re dedicated to helping every utility become a Sustainable Utility. That means doing the hard work it takes to achieve goals that often seem at odds with one another:

Environmental responsibility: Decarbonizing operations, reducing emissions, eliminating water leaks, and finding efficiencies
Reliability: Providing safe, continuous, and consistent service in the face of increasing volatility caused by climate change, including extreme weather, drought, and fire
Equity: Making services and programs truly available to all, especially low- and moderate-income residential customers and small and midsize businesses who are often disproportionately impacted by societal events
Financial stability: Ensuring a bottom line that affords capital and operational expenditures while enabling innovation and giving back to our communities

E Source blends industry-leading research, predictive data science, and solution services to help utilities make better decisions to serve their customers, their bottom line, and our planet. With a commitment to practical innovation, we use more than three decades of utility-focused experience and our unique solution set to help our clients become a Sustainable Utility.

It's time to build. Whether it's creating more housing, upgrading our infrastructure, or adapting to climate change, one thing is clear: the construction industry is at the center of solving our biggest problems. We’re making buildings cheaper and easier to build by transforming the way commercial construction companies buy their materials. Join us.
Founded in 2018, Kojo is now one of the fastest-growing construction technology companies in the world. Construction accounts for $10 trillion in global spend annually and we can’t live without its output - our roads, schools, hospitals, and offices. Despite this, there’s been very little innovation over the past 70 years in how materials - which constitute up to 40% of project costs - are bought and sold. This is our opportunity.
We’re looking for a Data Scientist / ML Engineer for Kojo’s intelligent procurement platform. This highly impactful role will be a part of our small DS function and build machine learning models, analyze and process various types of data for our customer-facing product to supercharge our customers’ materials procurement decisions.

Providing uniquely valuable insights to our customers with dashboard, reports, and recommendations
Working on initiatives to ensure the stability, performance and reliability of our data infrastructure
About You
An impactful and collaborative Data Scientist with experience building ML/AI models for customer-facing products will thrive in this role! If you’re excited about applying your skills to weave insights, recommendations, and AI into the Kojo platform, apply with us!
What you’ve accomplished:
3+ years of experience in an ML-focused data role
Experience with our tech stack: Python, SQL, and BI Tooling required; + Azure, AWS, GCP, and Docker preferred
Track record of executing quickly and iterating effectively on projects
Empathy when working with internal cross-functional stakeholders and on client-facing work
A history of raising the quality of real-world business and usage data to the level required to produce reliable insights.
Keen ability to translate nontechnical requests into precise and reliable terms
An understanding of complex disparate data sources and how to unify them
What you care about:
Customer Obsession: You care deeply about our customers and go the extra mile to delight them
Innovation: You look for the truth behind problems and for “10x” solutions

Equity: Making services and programs truly available to all, especially low- and moderate-income residential customers and small and midsize businesses who are often disproportionately impacted by societal events
Financial stability: Ensuring a bottom line that affords capital and operational expenditures while enabling innovation and giving back to our communities

E Source blends industry-leading research, predictive data science, and solution services to help utilities make better decisions to serve their customers, their bottom line, and our planet.

Chicago, IL","At Diverge Health we are a team of entrepreneurs passionate about improving health access and outcomes for those most in need. We partner with primary care providers to improve the engagement and management of their Medicaid patients, providing independent practices access to specialized resources and clinical programs to address medical, social and behavioral patient needs. Our care ecosystem is equipped with enhanced technology and data interfaces to enable provider and patient success in a value-based environment. Guided by our core values of humility, continuous learning and feeling the weight, our team is on a mission to strengthen communities from within, unlocking people's ability to live their healthiest lives.
We are looking for a Healthcare Data Scientist to join our team! This is a highly visible role on our growing team, who will help pioneer and grow advanced analytic capabilities in healthcare as we work to improve care for the disadvantaged. This role reports directly to the Senior Vice President, Technology.
Who We Are:
We are a team of entrepreneurs passionate about improving health access and outcomes for those most in need. Diverge Health supports primary care practices to extend their reach and better serve patients on Medicaid. We bring providers significant infrastructure - contracts, local community health teams, provider liaisons, enabling technology and data – to improve outcomes for low-income patients, and enable success in value-based contracts.
Our technology organization is a small, growing team of problem solvers committed to improving healthcare outcomes for key disadvantaged populations. Our fully remote, entrepreneurial workforce strives to be…
Innovative – We love creative problem solvers capable of outside the box solutioning, and who work hard to find simple solutions to hard problems.
Independent – We take ownership of problems and have pride in our solutions, while working independently and supporting each other's efforts.
Adaptive – As a small team, we all lean in across the breadth of our technologies and love to learn new technologies and dive into new areas - and to figure things out as we go.

What We Do:
We create and execute our technology enablement efforts – from software development to data/analytics, to infrastructure, and enterprise technologies. We work collaboratively across internal stakeholders to understand business problems and needs, and design & implement solutions that support our mission of providing effective and transformative patient-centered care.
Our data scientists team leverages integrations with all types of healthcare data - claims data, electronic health/medical records, healthcare information exchanges, continuity of care information, admit/discharge records, etc – to help identify patients that would benefit most from focused care efforts, and uses data to help shape the plans that offer care to this population. We leverage census and other population data to locate where such populations exist and are centered so that services can be effectively offered to large populations. We work to continually shape and improve healthcare so that it becomes both more effective and more cost-effective by analyzing clinical results and feeding that into future strategies.
We leverage a collection of cloud-based tools to store, analyze, and report within our data efforts. Our team members might leverage Snowflake to store vast SQL databases – defining data models thru dbt and integrations thru Hightouch or Dagster. Or they may leverage reporting capabilities of Sigma, Salesforce, or more to visualize results. They can leverage advanced databases of AWS such as Dynamo for NoSQL or Neptune for relational queries, and use the cloud for complex AI calculations with Jupyter notebooks in Sagemaker or other machine learning platforms.
How You Can Help Us:
Here are some key areas where we're looking to make our team stronger:
Knowledge of healthcare ecosystems, information & analytics – we don't need a healthcare expert as we'll have others who can provide deep industry expertise, but general knowledge of the data sources, types, nomenclature, etc is important. This kind of knowledge often comes with 2-5 years of experience in healthcare but can be shown with other strong HCLS examples. We're expecting this role to quickly address such problems such as market analyses, risk stratification, & operational efficiency, and move on to problems in clinical efficacy and healthcare quality metrics. We'd love to hear what you've done in similar areas, and where you're looking to expand.
Advanced SQL, analytics, and statistical background – someone who can understand the math and help navigate alternative statistical strategies. Having projects where you've investigated alternative data sources and approaches, and discussing how you helped guide teams to a successful decision and results, are a great way to demonstrate the ability to go deep.
Adaptable willingness and ability to support the team and achieve results – someone who has shown themselves willing to jump into new areas, learn new technologies, and do so quickly in a way that impacts the business. Being able to discuss examples of having a measurable impact on the business and mastering new technologies would show how you are focused on making a difference for the team and the company.
Keeping things simple – someone who remains focused on simple, reliable solutions even when the problems seem complex. We'd love to hear precedents where you took something really complicated and were able solve it with something simple, or in a way that addressed an even bigger problem in a general, flexible way.
And as potential bonus areas, we're also interested to hear about your
More in-depth previous experience in healthcare or with healthcare informatics/analytics, demonstrating in-depth knowledge of healthcare industry and terminology
Breadth of data skills across the board with knowledge of infrastructures (in Snowflake, AWS), data modeling, reporting & visualizations, statistics/analytics, AI/ML, Jupyter notesbooks, etc – we're still a small team and being able to demonstrate breadth of knowledge is as important as demonstrating depth.
A demonstrated ability to impact care quality and quality gaps – showing you can help quantify care quality or measure HEDIS/STARS metrics is a great benefit
History of automating data, analytics, and AI/ML pipelines to improve developer reliability, speed, and quality.

About the role
As a Staff Data Scientist, you will be responsible for partnering with our Matchmaker team to build, launch, and iterate on new versions of our client-clinician matching algorithm. Matching is at the heart of Two Chairs' experience, helping us make high-quality matches at scale that drive best-in-class retention in therapy and strong therapeutic outcomes. You will partner with technical leaders across the organization to understand our approach towards Matchmaking, own the technical implementation of the Matchmaking algorithm, and design and implement experiments to improve it. In this role, you will work closely with other members of the data science and data engineering team and cross-functionally with Product, Engineering, Operations, and Clinical Leadership. This role has the unique opportunity to build technology that directly helps get clients into care faster while making matches that therapists love.

Core Areas of Responsibility
The Matchmaker algorithm [70%]
Your primary job responsibility will be to build, launch, and iterate on new versions of our Matchmaker algorithm.
This will include writing production modeling code and collaborating with Software Engineers to implement that code in production.
You will help us evolve our current algorithm from an internal component of an engineering application to a data-science-owned service that is scalable, observable, improves yield, and gracefully incorporates new business functionality.
Part of this will involve developing an evolved perspective on how our objective function and constraints are framed.
Data Platform [20%]
You will partner with Data Engineering and DevOps to evolve our ML infrastructure, improving our ability to reliably serve production models and compare the impact of different models in statistically valid ways.
This partnership includes work to generalize our ML infrastructure to serve other use cases at the business.
Matchmaker Analytics [10%]
You will have the ownership to develop the right set of metrics for evaluating different versions of these algorithms, creating a scalable approach for this type of analysis, and executing that analysis as new models are tested.
As you learn more about the Matching ecosystem at Two Chairs, you'll support the Matchmaker team with relevant data and analysis to highlight trends and opportunities in the system.
Impact and Success Indicators
Where you'll make an impact in the first 90 days:
Demonstrate full end-to-end knowledge of Two Chairs' Matching Ecosystem.
Become proficient with the data generated and stored during the Matching process.
Collaborate with engineers and data scientists to begin implementing initial improvements to the algorithm.
Challenge our existing assumptions and constraints, bringing a fresh perspective to Two Chairs' approach to Matchmaking.
Where you'll make an impact in the first year:
Accomplish a vast suite of improvements to the Matchmaker algorithm which helps clients get into care much faster while keeping the quality of a match high.
Enable Two Chairs to pursue different supply/demand optimization strategies based on different states, insurance partners, or client populations.
Be a core contributor to new data science ML platform infrastructure to enable other ML products in the business to be more easily realized.
Contribute to novel research, including sharing our research in white papers and publications
You'll be successful if you have:
Extensive experience developing and maintaining models from the discovery stage to production. Hands-on ML Ops experience and experience with ML in GCP is a plus
Expertise in framing complex problems
Experience with supply and demand optimization and iterating on complex objective functions
Exceptional command of Python and relevant ML libraries and tools
Experience with randomized experimentation at scale
M.S. or Ph.D. in Statistics, Operations Research, Mathematics, Computer Science, or other quantitative fields or related work experience
Ability to build strong, collaborative partnerships with stakeholders
Solid analytical thinking with the ability to translate business problems into scoped analytics problems
Skilled in using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency while balancing tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.

Los Angeles, CA","AE Studio is an LA-based company focused on increasing human agency while maintaining our ineffable culture and whimsy. If the work diminishes agency, we may simply decide to “eff” it after all. In our Venice CA office and our respective domiciles live a team of highly-skilled developers, data scientists, and dubiously-lucid humorists building agency-increasing products you may recall from such sentences as the one in this paragraph. We’ve worked with Samsung, Walmart, Berkshire Hathaway, and other large, important entities you’ve probably heard of. Our work environment is fantastic for aspiring coders, calculators, and entrepreneurs. Also, we have neither VC, nor PE, nor other acronyms funding us. We have a weird business model where we sell our work for a profit and use those profits to pay people (I told you it was weird!).
More specifically, we deploy the proceeds from our consulting work in development and data science and our skunkworks proceeds to support research into cause areas we think are of paramount interest to human beings. We have made a name for ourselves in cutting-edge brain computer interface (BCI) R&D, and now we want to replicate past successes and solve the problem of AI alignment (aligning future powerful systems with human best interests). We want to optimize for human agency, if you feel similarly, please to support our research efforts. Data scientists will have the opportunity between client projects to work on important alignment research, with the opportunity to potentially have your research project prioritized if particularly promising.
Do you have strong problem-solving skills? Do you have a disposition suited for self-management? Have you ever composed a Gilbert and Sullivan parody that would offend Victorian sensibilities? If you can say “yes” to two of those three questions, please !
ABOUT YOU
Fluency in Python–used often, derided occasionally, and considered its eponymous reference to the best of British sketch comedy
Proven data science experience–primary or equal contributor, multiple smaller projects, management of steak-holders (so projects come out ‘well-done’)
Comfort with the statistics and methods deployed in classification problems–that is, the ability to see the random forest for the trees
Familiarity with NLP/NLU–even if this posting’s language is a bit unnatural, we suspect you’ll understand our process
Experience calling machine learning APIs via REST or client libraries - and determining that their responses lack wit, guile, and tact
Agile experience (worked with Kanban, Scrum, Extreme Programming)–or a sound literary understanding of Steve Martin’s “Picasso at the Lapin Agile,” even if you don’t speak French
Growth mindset – You had better be funnier after the first 90 days...
Willingness to learn our systems (wait, we have systems?)
Full-time availability–but if you have cool side projects that increase human agency, we totally want you to keep working on it...we’ll even help!
Demonstrated ability to work independently/autonomously
Ability to communicate effectively and work exclusively in English. This is a must, our ability to crack jokes in other languages is decidedly de rigeur...
BONUS POINTS FOR
Experience with self-managed data science projects–show us your cool side hustles, especially if they increase human agency or include obscure references!
Software development background - We need help with syntax in English too...
Experience working with / building / training deep learning-based computer vision or NLP models or LLMs – extra double-secret bonus points for identifying Schroedinger’s cat in a video
JavaScript / Node.js experience–require(‘sense of humor’)
Clean Code, Unit Tests, Lather, Rinse, Repeat
Experience managing clients and client relationships–because, y’know, they pay us...
Experience in Startups–because, y’know, we kinda are one, or actually more like several startups all rolled into one!
You care about AI alignment, and are optimistic in humanity’s capacity to problem solve and safely navigate accelerating AI capabilities and have an awesome future
Equity
Working at AE means receiving equity in some of our client projects and in the Skunkworks projects we incubate. The equity granted is priced at a value of $0 when you receive it. If it were otherwise, you’d be forced to pay taxes. But to be clear, there are no free lunches, only the choice of who pays for your sandwich.
At AE, the equity you receive is not free to AE. We invest millions annually in Skunkworks projects - paying our employees to build technology for which no client pays a bill. We receive equity from certain clients, which means we accept less in terms of our billable rate. We then pass that equity on to our employees. Sure it’s priced at $0 on day 1 - a call option on a stock trading at $100 with a strike price of $100 is priced at $0 today for tax purposes, but you’d want to receive that option. If you received that option on a dozen stocks, you’d be fairly confident that some of them would be worth a lot more than $0.
Offering this equity (by investing in Skunkworks or offering clients a lower rate) comes out of AE’s margins. Theoretically, we should be lowering salaries to compensate. But we’re competitive on that front as well. Over the long-term, we believe AE employees who stick around are likely to fare extremely well monetarily (no legal promises). We think long-term. You should too when you choose your employer.
We are looking to hire people who think long term. People create exponentially more value here in their 3rd or 4th year rather than their 1st or 2nd, and that only increases. The value you create leads to more equity issued every year, and you retain it while you remain at AE or at a Skunkworks co that spins out, in order to free up equity for others, which is how we afford to be generous with the equity.
Disclaimer: If you leave AE on good terms, you can retain 20% of your equity if you continue to send leads our way, share our core values, etc. If you leave AE for your own AE-incubated Skunkworks project (or someone else’s), you retain 100% of your equity. Folks create exponentially more value here in their 3rd and 4th years than their 1st or 2nd - we want folks who think long-term like we do.
Salary range from $120k/year to $220k/year. Not in the range? That's fine, you can still and our team may fit you in a more senior position that we're not actively hiring right now, but we are growing fast and may have other openings soon.

You’ve got a natural attention to detail and drive for order that yields accuracy and reliability in the data you work with.
You can own the critical trust-based relationship with our internal stakeholders.
You have experience in and a passion for visualizing data to tell clear stories and support decision-making.

Burlingame, CA","Who you are
The first Data Scientist at Finrise will play an imperative role in enabling patient financing for out-of-pocket healthcare expenses. You recognize that 56% of Americans with a less than ideal FICO Score need new ways to evaluate creditworthiness in efficient and holistic ways. You’re excited about tackling technical problems that most wouldn’t dare touch. Working with unstructured and nontraditional data doesn’t scare you. Data science, predictive models, and statistics are second nature. You excel in building machine learning systems, conducting foolproof analyses, and leading cross functional projects. While banks are busy evaluating 30-year-old FICO scores, created before a time of the internet and smartphones, you’re building models which will decide who to lend to in real-time. Instead of hiring hundreds of people to manually review, you’re adding new data points to ensure accurate scoring. You’re hands-on, creative, and hyper-analytical. You understand that the ultimate measurement of success is enabling patients to afford care in a time of need, with a fair rate, in terms they understand. At the end of the day, you want to change the way credit is evaluated.

Our collaborative approach is an integral part of successful programs that decrease ratepayer energy bills while also achieving environmental goals such as deferring fossil fuel power plant projects.
ADM is based out of Sacramento, CA, with satellite offices in Fremont, CA, and Reno, NV. We have remote staff working all over the country and currently provide each employee the opportunity to develop an in-office/work from home schedule that best fits their lifestyle, client needs, and career development.

Manipulate large data sets in R (10 GB and bigger).
Utilize Functional Programing and Vectorized Analyses to solve complicated problems.
Take analyses that have been previously completed in less flexible software packages (e.g., Excel) and implement them in R.
Develop interfaces for clients that allow them to manipulate, visualize, and analyze data in the R environment (e.g., via interactive web applications via Shiny).
Develop and implement various data-mining techniques that may assist clients with targeted marketing efforts (e.g., Naïve Bayes, cluster analysis, logistic regression, Principal Components Analysis).
Experience with program evaluation, statistics, survey design, or energy efficiency and energy systems is a plus. The following qualifications are desirable:
Excellent analytical and problem-solving skills.
Proficiency in Microsoft Excel and other Microsoft Office applications for reporting.
Professional experience in the energy efficiency, public policy, environmental consulting, or market research fields is desirable, but not required.
Ability to coordinate multiple projects simultaneously and under time pressures.

Seattle, WA","Who we are:
Want to make an impact? Join our pack and come work (and play!) with us.

We believe everyone deserves the unconditional love of a pet—and at Rover, our mission is to make it easier to experience that love. Founded in 2011, the Rover app and website connect dog and cat parents with loving pet sitters and dog walkers in neighborhoods across the US, Canada, and Europe. We empower our community of trusted pet sitters and dog walkers to run their own pet care businesses on Rover with the tools and security of a global company to back them.

Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, we work closely with our teams in Barcelona, San Antonio, Spokane, and remote locations. We’ve got a reputation for being a great place to work, having been named among the 100 Best Companies to Work For in Seattle Business Magazine and Washington’s Best Workplaces in the Puget Sound Business Journal. We're an agile, fast-growing company, and our leadership comes from some of the world's most respected tech companies.

At Rover, our furry coworkers are just as important as our human ones—and we wouldn’t have it any other way. Along with making the joys of pet parenthood more accessible, we’re committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming community of pet people—and that starts with our employees.

Who we're looking for:

We are looking for people who understand that behind every data point there is a pet and a person. When you develop and deploy an algorithm, you are not just producing a score or rule set, you are altering the customer experience and impacting the business in measurable ways. You should be excited to tackle a broad array of problems facing a two-sided marketplace and work in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.

What does Data Science mean at Rover?

At Rover we obsess over our customers’ needs, relying heavily on data to improve the customer journey, and to continuously optimize outcomes in our marketplaces. Data scientists are responsible for defining the right metrics, understanding nuanced marketplace dynamics, and developing models and algorithms that power our business and technology. As a senior data scientist on the Supply Data Science team, you will be a strategic leader in the economic management of supply and demand at Rover.
As a Data Scientist You Will:
Navigate the complex dynamics of the marketplace to optimally manage supply and demand balance amid hundreds of localities, multiple service lines, and strong seasonal fluctuations.
Collaborate closely with business, product, marketing, and operations teams to pinpoint opportunities for enhanced efficiency in our marketplace.
Develop and refine data science models to inform strategic decision-making and manage the efficient scaling of Rover’s global sitter and walker communities.
Design, build, and maintain robust data pipelines and models that power product features.
Dive deep into marketplace dynamics, extracting valuable insights and providing strategic recommendations to shape our product offerings, using your skills in data analysis and data visualization.
Perform statistical analysis to evaluate marketplace experiments, forecast future trends, and predict user behavior.

Your Toolset Includes:
SQL - you would be comfortable leading an advanced SQL course
Python or a similar computational programming language (we mostly use Python but can provide training)
Data visualization (we use Mode as our data visualization tool, but you could have experience in any other tool or library such as Tableau, Sisense, Matplotlib, ggplot)
Experience with big data technology (e.g. Spark, AWS) a plus

Your Qualifications:
BS in a quantitative discipline; advanced degree (MS or PhD) a plus. Economics backgrounds will be highly valued.
At least 3 years of experience as a data scientist or analyst in a business setting
Experience managing complex projects with large cross-team dependencies, involving both technical and non-technical partners
Expertise with statistical concepts including probability, hypothesis testing, experimental design, and linear and logistic regression
Robust foundation with one or more contemporary machine learning or predictive modeling algorithms, such as ensemble methods, natural language processing (NLP) techniques, clustering algorithms, or deep learning methods
Experience with simulation (e.g. Monte Carlo, discrete event simulation) will be valued.
Experience in a two-sided marketplace is a plus.

Why We'll Hire You:
You have the technical skills to lead the development of production-facing data science applications.
You can take abstractly defined economics problems and work with (imperfect) data to drive decisions.
You are passionate about our core business. You will instinctively dig into every aspect of what it means to be a pet sitter and a pet owner on the Rover platform.
You’re a deeply analytical thinker who is passionate about finding structure in data, and using data to drive real value to the end user (and thus the business).
You’re able to fit and interpret results of statistical models, as well as report on key assumptions and limitations.
You show a pattern of being self-started, self-taught, and self-directed.
You favor open communication with willingness to ask and answer questions.
You are output- and outcome-oriented.
You have excellent written and verbal communication skills in English, with the ability to break apart complex processes for non-technical stakeholders.
You play nicely with others (and dogs).

By building the future of identity verification in the United States and reinventing the currently clunky, ineffective, and expensive process, we believe strongly that the future will be 10x better.
We’ve had tremendous traction and are growing extremely quickly. Already our real-time APIs have helped verify hundreds of millions of identities, beginning with financial services. In 2021, we raised a $70M Series B round, led by Craft Ventures to rapidly scale our best in class products.
